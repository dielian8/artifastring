Video can only be produced with blender 2.5 or higher.


BASIC TEST

You can produce 3 images in /tmp/vivi-movie/  with:
  make test


ENTIRE VIDEO

To produce the entire video, use
  make
or (same thing)
  make mpeg
# TODO: h264 not upgraded for the blender 2.5 system yet
#or (h264 output)
#  make avi


LOW QUALITY

Output currently defaults to low quality (by using our
custom -k "flag" when calling blender).  To see a sample
of high quality, run
  make quality-test
for an entire movie, run
  make quality-avi


ACTIONS FILES

The Makefile is pretty much just an example.  It's based around
unit.actions, which is probably not what you want to view.  In the
main Vivi code base, this Makefile is never used; instead, we
construct different command-lines and call them with python.

I'll be thinking about providing a nicer way of handling alternate
actions files... it kind-of depends if anybody wants to use this
by itself, without Vivi to generate sensible .actions files.  I'll
also accept patches that improve the Makefile and/or add it to
scons and/or other better solutions.  :)
